随着LAMP(Linux+Apache+Mysql+PHP)的广泛应用和不断扩大的用户群，开发速度和成本上的优势逐渐明显，互联网上的“大鳄”也开始窥视LAMP这块大蛋糕。于是网上有这样两个传说：B-)
为什么Sun要收购MYSQL?[新闻来源](http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html)
> Scott(Scott McNealy, founder and chairman of Sun): "I knew this Java thing was a bad idea in the first place! I see only one solution. We need to buy this Lamp!"
> Accountant: "Euh, LAMP is not a company. It's an acronym. It's Linux , Apache, MySQL and PHP"
> Scott: "Then buy me Linux!"
> Accountant: "But we still have this Solaris thing.."
> Scott: "Then buy me Apache!"
> Accountant: "That's a foundation. Nothing to buy there."
> Scott: "Then buy me MySQL!"
> Accountant: "We don't do databases."
> Scott: "It's a database?"
> Accountant: "What rock have you been living under?"
> Scott: "Sweet. I can own the Lamp AND piss off Oracle at the same time!" (waves fake plastic magic wand) "Make it so!"
为什么Microsoft要收购Yahoo? [新闻来源](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-01CorpNewsPR.mspx)
> Steve(Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO): "Hey, you heard about this PHP thing?"
> Bill(Bill Gates): "Pee Age Pee? You're not that old yet, are you?"
> Steve: "What? No, wait, it's a programming language, apparently better than ASP.NET."
> Bill: "Who cares if it's better. I mean; we made the worst operating systems ever and still rule. (Checked out Leopard yet? It is SO cool.)"
> Steve: "I don't know Bill... remember that internet thing that we didn't know about years ago? Kind of nearly missed the boat there."
> Bill: "Right. Didn't we solve that in the same way? Worst browser, highest market share, that sort of thing?"
> Steve: "Yes we did, but then we also didn't know about this 'mp3' thing until it was too late."
> Bill: "We did manage to make Zune the worst player, but somehow we're not market leader. Guess we got sloppy?"
> Steve: "Maybe it's just different times. Maybe we should have a different strategy."
> Bill: "Ok, so let's just buy PHP then."
> Steve: "It's not a company. But Encarta says it's written by a Rasmus Lerdorf."
> Bill: "So let's hire him."
> Steve: "Tried that. Didn't want to join. Can't blame him, works at Yahoo."
> Bill: "Then I guess we'll have to buy Yahoo."
