The main advantage of [WebGL](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page) is that cross-device, cross-platform and zero-install. It's the new revolution for 3D entertainment on the Internet. It's the future.

It's possible to utilize CUDA from within Jetpack now. (See the [Jetpack-to-CUDA project](http://mozillalabs.com/jetpack/2009/11/10/jetpack-0-5-contest-a-winner/))
> Jetpack.toGPU() is that hint. Under the hood of Jetpack.toGPU() there is translation of function(nums, numsSize) {…} to CUDA Kernel and a method of sending C-code to the GPU. Jetpack.toGPU() should be non-blocking. It means “some job” will be done while resNumbers is calculating. Of course, a developer could write their own CUDA Kernel in C to be sent to the GPU. This technique is like in similar to the PyCUDA project.
